'''Write a program to construct a dictionary from the two lists
containing the names of students and their corresponding
subjects. The dictionary should map the students with their
respective subjects. Letâ€™s see how to do this using for loops and
dictionary comprehension.
Input: [Sam, Alice, Mona] ,
[Commerce, Science, Computer]
Output: [Sam: Commerce, Alice: Science , Mona: Computer]'''

    return student_subject_dict

names = ['Sam', 'Alice', 'Mona'],['Commerce', 'Science', 'Computer']

result_with_for_loop = construct_dictionary_with_for_loop(names, subjects)
