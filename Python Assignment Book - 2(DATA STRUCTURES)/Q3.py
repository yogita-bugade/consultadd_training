'''How Tuple is beneficial as compared to the list?'''

'''Tuples and lists are both sequential data types in Python, but they have some key differences in terms of their 
properties, immutability, and intended use cases. Here are some benefits of tuples compared to lists:

Immutability: Tuples are immutable, meaning once they are created, their elements cannot be changed, added, 
or removed. This immutability provides safety against accidental modification of data, making tuples suitable 
for storing fixed collections of items that shouldn('t change. This property is particularly useful when you want '
'to ensure that certain data remains unchanged throughout your program.)

Performance: Tuples are generally faster than lists for accessing elements because they are immutable. 
Since tuples cannot be modified after creation, Python('s interpreter can make certain optimizations, resulting '
('in faster access times compared to lists. This can be beneficial in situations where you have a large collection of '
'data that doesn'))t need to be modified frequently.

Hashability: Tuples are hashable if all their elements are hashable. This means that tuples can be used as keys in 
dictionaries and elements in sets, whereas lists cannot be used as keys in dictionaries because they are mutable. 
The hashability of tuples makes them suitable for use cases where you need to create data structures like dictionaries 
with keys that are not subject to change.

Syntactic Simplicity: Tuples have a simpler syntax compared to lists. They are created using parentheses () instead 
of square brackets [], which makes them more concise for representing fixed collections of data. This simplicity can 
improve code readability and maintainability, especially when dealing with small, unchanging collections of items.

Safe Return Multiple Values: Functions in Python can return multiple values as tuples. Since tuples are immutable, they 
provide a safe way to return multiple values from functions without the risk of accidentally modifying the returned data.

While tuples offer these benefits, it('s important to note that lists have their advantages too, such as mutability,dynamic '
resizing, and a richer set of built-in methods for manipulation. The choice between tuples and lists depends on the specific
requirements and constraints of your program)'''
